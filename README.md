OPDB API is the standard and preferred way to integrate OpenPhish Database into existing systems and to build custom tools around it. The API is delivered as a Python module, which interacts with a local, periodically updated copy of the OpenPhish Database.

The OPDB API has a simple command line interface which allows you to quickly automate SOC playbooks or research tasks. It can also be used programmatically to integrate OPDB into your existing tools, or develop new tools for your operations.

In order to use the OPDB API you need to have a valid production or free trial license.
